### Hi there, I'm Arudradev 👋

**Research Engineer | Neuro-Symbolic Computing | Full Stack Developer**

I build software that challenges the boundaries between **Deterministic Logic** and **Probabilistic AI**. My goal is to decouple software from hardware constraints using Neural State Inference.

### 🚀 Featured Project: The Neural Kernel

> *"Why calculate `2+2` when you can simulate the physics of a CPU?"*

I am currently building a **Neural Operating System** architecture. It replaces standard CPU/GPU pipelines with a hybrid AI model:
*   **Logic:** A Neural ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) simulating NAND/XOR gates using software neurons.
*   **Rendering:** A Generative Neural Network that "hallucinates" the UI based on logic states.
*   **Streaming:** Cloud-native MJPEG/WebRTC streaming to low-end devices.
